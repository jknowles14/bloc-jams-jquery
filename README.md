# bloc-jams-jquery
A project to practice refactoring an existing code base using jQuery. The goal is to make a finished app that will be a fully functional music player. It will display album information, list the songs for an album, and include standard music controls for playing, pausing, skipping forward/backward, and adjusting the volume.
